Hello, and welcome to my Password Brute Force Program!
This is a menu-based program which allows you to either:

  1) Input a SHA-256 hash to brute-force.
  2) Input a plain-text password (the program will hash and brute-force it).

Upon completion, you can terminate the code using the exit option in the menu.

Enjoy!
